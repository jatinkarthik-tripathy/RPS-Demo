# Pattern Prediction using LSTM and ReLU Ensemble

Uses LSTM and ReLU ensemble to predict the next move of the user based on previous moves of the user and the computer AI. This time series prediction model proves to be incredibly accurate giving test accuracy over 80% (ie: correct prediction of the the users next move).
